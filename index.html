<p>I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://amath.washington.edu%22%3E">applied mathematics</a> department at the University of Washington. I study algorithms, specifically iterative methods for linear systems. I’m interested in incorporating probabilistic methods into traditional linear algebra algorithms. Previously, I graduated from Tufts University with a BS in math and physics, and a minor in <a href="http://design.chen.pw">studio art</a>.</p>

<p>Here is my <a href="./cv.pdf">curriculum vitae (cv)</a>, and here is more information about my <a href="./research">research</a>.</p>

I try to make academia more welcoming and accessible. I’m particularly interested in promoting <a href="./thoughts/mental_health.html">mental health</a> awareness among grad students as well as in <a href="./thoughts/reproducibility.html">opening up science</a> to anyone with a desire to learn.

</p>

<p>My <a href="https://github.com/tchen01">Github</a> contains academic and personal projects, as well as useful resources for students in the amath program at UW.</p>

<p>You can email me at <a href="mailto:chentyl@uw.edu">chentyl@uw.edu</a>, answer my questions on <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/352534/tch">StackExchange</a>, or follow me on <a href="https://instagram.com/chen.tyler">Instagram</a>.</p>
