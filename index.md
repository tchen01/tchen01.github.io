In the fall, I will be joining New York University as a Courant Instructor.
I graduated from the University of Washington with a PhD in [applied mathematics](https://amath.washington.edu) and from Tufts University with degrees in math and physics and a minor in studio art.
    
I believe in empowering others to contribute to science. 
This means developing techniques and algorithms which help researchers to tackle the big problems of today, as well as working to build up the next generation of scientists.
Here is my [curriculum vitae (cv)](./cv.pdf), and here is more information about my [research](./research).
