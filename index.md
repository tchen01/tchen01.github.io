I am a PhD student in the [applied mathematics](https://amath.washington.edu">) department at the University of Washington. I study algorithms, specifically iterative methods for linear systems. 
I'm interested in incorporating probabilistic techniques into traditional linear algebra algorithms. 
Previously, I graduated from Tufts University with a BS in math and physics, and a minor in [studio art](http://design.chen.pw).
    
Here is my [curriculum vitae (cv)](./cv.pdf), and here is more information about my [research](./research).
    
I try to make academia more welcoming and accessible. 
I'm particularly interested in promoting [mental health](./thoughts/mental_health.html) awareness among grad students as well as in [opening up science](./thoughts/reproducibility.html) to anyone with a desire to learn. 
    
My [Github](https://github.com/tchen01) contains academic and personal projects, as well as resources for students taking amath courses at UW.
