I am a PhD student in the [applied mathematics](https://amath.washington.edu) department at the University of Washington, where I'm supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
I study algorithms, specifically Krylov subspace methods.
Previously, I graduated from Tufts University with a BS in math and physics, and a minor in studio art.
    
Here is my [curriculum vitae (cv)](./cv.pdf
), and here is more information about my [research](./research).
    
I believe in empowering others to contribute to science. 
This means developing techniques and algorithms which help others to tackle the big problems of today, as well as working to build up the next generation of scientists.
I'm particularly interested in promoting [mental health](./thoughts/mental_health.html) awareness among grad students and in [opening up science](./thoughts/reproducibility.html) to anyone with a desire to learn. 

My [Github](https://github.com/tchen01) contains files to help reproduce the results of my research, resources for students taking amath courses at UW, and some of my side projects.
