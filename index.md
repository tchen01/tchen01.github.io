I am a PhD student in the [applied mathematics](https://amath.washington.edu) department at the University of Washington, where I'm supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). 
I am also currently a research intern at the Baidu Research.
Previously, I graduated from Tufts University with a BS in math and physics, and a minor in studio art.
    

I believe in empowering others to contribute to science. 
This means developing techniques and algorithms which help others to tackle the big problems of today, as well as working to build up the next generation of scientists.
Here is my [curriculum vitae (cv)](./cv.pdf), and here is more information about my [research](./research).
