I am a PhD student in the [applied mathematics](https://amath.washington.edu">) department at the University of Washington. I study algorithms, specifically parallelizable iterative methods for linear systems. I'm interested in incorporating probabilistic methods into traditional linear algebra algorithms. Previously, I graduated from Tufts University with a BS in math and physics, and a minor in [studio art](http://design.chen.pw).
    
Here is my [curriculum vitae (cv)](./cv.pdf), and here is more information about my [research](./research).
    
I try to make academia more welcoming and accessible. I'm particularly interested in promoting [mental health](./thoughts/mental_health.html) awareness among grad students as well as in [opening up science](./thoughts/reproducibility.html) to anyone with a desire to learn.</p> 
    
My [Github](https://github.com/tchen01) contains academic and personal projects, as well as useful resources for students in the amath program at UW.
