This is a companion piece to the publication:

On the Convergence of Conjugate Gradient Variants in Finite Precision Arithmetic. Anne Greenbaum, Hexuan Liu, Tyler Chen. In progress.

A preprint will be on ArXiV in the near future.

### Introduction
If you are not familiar with Krylov subspace methods, it may be worth reading [this page](./krylov_methods.html) first.

### Conjugate Gradient

### Why should I care?
Need new algorithms to deal with modern HPC architecture. But can't sacrifice accuracy. 

Take advantage of lower precision for ML type applications.
