    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>I work in the field of Numerical Linear Algebra, specifically on <a href="./krylov_methods.html">Krylov subspace methods</a>. I'm interested in incorporating probabilistic techniques into classical algorithms to develop methods which are fast and reliable, both in theory and in practice. I'm committed to making my research accessible and facilitating the <a href="../thoughts/reproducibility.html">reproducibility</a> of my work. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns about my research.</p>
    <p>I am advised by <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/greenbau/">Anne Greenbaum</a>.</p>
    
    <p>This page contains a collection of the things I've been working on recently, and in general, I try to include a preprint and a description of the work which is readable by a broader audience interested in the field.</p>

    
    <h3>Papers</h3>
    <div class="paper">
        <div class="title"><a href="./greenbaum_liu_chen_19.html">On the Convergence of Conjugate Gradient Varients in Finite Precision Arithmetic.</a></div>
        <div class="authors">Anne Greenbaum, Hexuan Liu, and Tyler Chen.</div>
        <div class="details">In preparation.</div>

    <h3>Collaboration</h3>
    <p>I'm always interested in finding things to collaborate on.</p>
    <p>If you are an undergrad student wanting to get involved in research, or are interested in grad school please feel free to reach out. I'd be happy to try to help you find something to work on! You may also be interested in the <a href="https://amath.washington.edu/women-applied-mathematics-mentorship-program">Women in Applied Mathematics Mentorship Program</a>.</p>
