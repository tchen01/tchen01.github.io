The less time scientists have to wait for code to run, the more time they can spend thinking about the problems they are tackling.
My research aims to develop methods to support the scientists taking on the problems of today.

I'm interested in incorporating probabilistic techniques into classical algorithms to develop methods which are fast and reliable, both in theory and in practice.
Right now, I work in the field of numerical linear algebra on Krylov subspace methods such as the [conjugate gradient](./cg) and Lanczos methods.
I hope that my work will help to bridge the gap between theoretical computer science and applied computational science.

I am committed to making my research accessible and to facilitating the [reproducibility](../thoughts/reproducibility.html) of my work.
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns about my research.

I'm advised by [Anne Greenbaum](http://faculty.washington.edu/greenbau/) and [Tom Trogdon](http://faculty.washington.edu/trogdon/).


## Publications

More information can be found in my [CV](../cv.pdf).
In general, I've tried to include descriptions of all my papers which are readable by a broader audience interested in learning about or keeping up with recent advancements in the field.

## Collaboration

I'm always interested in finding things to collaborate on (and people to collaborate with).

If you're an undergrad student interested in research or grad school, please feel free to reach out; I'd be happy to try to help you find something to work on! You may also be interested in the [Washington Directed Reading Program](https://sites.uw.edu/wdrp/) as well as the [Women in Applied Mathematics Mentorship Program](https://amath.washington.edu/women-applied-mathematics-mentorship-program).
