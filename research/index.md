I work in the field of Numerical Linear Algebra, specifically on [Krylov subspace methods](./cg_intro.html). I'm interested in incorporating probabilistic techniques into classical algorithms to develop methods which are fast and reliable, both in theory and in practice. I'm committed to making my research accessible and to facilitating the [reproducibility](../thoughts/reproducibility.html) of my work. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns about my research.

I am advised by [Anne Greenbaum](http://faculty.washington.edu/greenbau/).
    
This page contains a collection of the things I've been working on recently. In general, I try to include a preprint and a description of the work which is readable by a broader audience interested in learning about or keeping up with recent advancements in the field. I also have some short introductory pieces on some interesting topics.

## Collaboration

I'm always interested in finding things to collaborate on.

If you are an undergrad student wanting to get involved in research, or are interested in grad school please feel free to reach out. I'd be happy to try to help you find something to work on!
