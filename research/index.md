I'm interested in incorporating probabilistic techniques into classical algorithms to develop methods which are fast and reliable, both in theory and in practice.
Right now I in the field of Numerical Linear Algebra on [Krylov subspace methods](./krylov).
I hope that my work will help to bridge the gap between theoretical computer science and applied computational science.

I am committed to making my research accessible and to facilitating the [reproducibility](../thoughts/reproducibility.html) of my work.
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns about my research.

I'm advised by [Anne Greenbaum](http://faculty.washington.edu/greenbau/).
    
This page contains a collection of the things I've been working on recently.
In general, I try to include a description of papers which are readable by a broader audience interested in learning about or keeping up with recent advancements in the field.
I also have some short introductory pieces on topics I think are interesting.

## Collaboration

I'm always interested in finding things to collaborate on (and people to collaborate with).

If you're an undergrad student interested in research or grad school, please feel free to reach out; I'd be happy to try to help you find something to work on!
