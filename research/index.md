The less time scientists have to wait for code to run, the more time they can spend thinking about the problems they are tackling.
My research aims to develop methods to support the scientists taking on the problems of today.

I'm interested in incorporating probabilistic techniques into classical algorithms to develop methods which are fast and reliable, both in theory and in practice.
Right now, I work in the field of numerical linear algebra on Krylov subspace methods such as the [conjugate gradient](./cg) and Lanczos methods.
I hope that my work will help to bridge the gap between numerical analysis, theoretical computer science, and applied computational sciences such as quantum physics.


I am currently a Courant Instructor, sponsored by [Chris Musco](https://chrismusco.com).
During my PhD I was advised by [Anne Greenbaum](https://faculty.washington.edu/greenbau/) and [Tom Trogdon](https://faculty.washington.edu/trogdon/).

## Collaboration

I'm always interested in finding things to collaborate on (and people to collaborate with).
These days I'm particularly interested in getting involved in the developtment of algorithms for specific application area problems.

If you're an undergrad student interested in research or grad school, please feel free to reach out; I'd be happy to try to chat with you about these topics! 


## Publications

A list of research publications can be found in my [CV](../cv.pdf) or on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=FD4TjnYAAAAJ).


My PhD thesis, *Lanczos-based methods for matrix functions*, can be found (here (soon!)).


I am committed to making my research accessible and to facilitating the reproducibility/replicability of my work. 
Code to generate the figures from my papers can be found on [Github](https://github.com/chentyl).
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns about my research.
