## Introduction

In our [derivation](./cg_derivation.html) of the Conjugate Gradient method, we minimized the $A$-norm of the error over sucessive Krylov subspaces. Ideally we would like to know how quickly this method converge. That is, how many iterations are needed to reach some level of accuracy.
