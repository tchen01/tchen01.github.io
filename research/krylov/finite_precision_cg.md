## Introduction

In our [derivation](./cg_derivation.html) of the Conjugate Gradient method, we minimized the $A$-norm of the error over sucessive Krylov subspaces. A key component of the subsequence [error analysis](./cg_error.html) was that the search directions constructed are $A$-orthogonal.

In finite precision, our induction based argument no longer holds.
