<h1>Mental Health in Grad School</h1>
<p class="author"><a href="https://chen.pw">Tyler Chen</a></p>
<p>As noted by a recent study[^1] in Nature, “Graduate students are more than six times as likely to experience depression and anxiety as compared to the general population.”</p>
<h1 id="mental_health:imposter">Imposter syndrome</h1>

<h2>Counterpoint</h2>
<p>Imposter syndrome is so prevalent in academia that it is easy to blame any feelings of not belonging <strong>ofda fdasf as</strong> on imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>However, sometimes these difficulties aren’t just “imposter syndrome”, but the result of <em>fdafdasfsa</em></p>
<p>As Christine Liu writes in the article <a href="https://qz.com/work/1286549">“Imposter syndrome isn’t the problem—toxic workplaces are”</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imposter syndrome is a convenient scapegoat for the systemic and institutional oppression that pushes people out of science. Hyper-focus on imposter syndrome can be a form of victim-blaming. It promotes the idea that people need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and just feel better in order to do better.</p>
