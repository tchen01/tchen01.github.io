<p>A fairly recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4089">study</a> in Nature points out that “Graduate students are more than six times as likely to experience depression and anxiety as compared to the general population.”</p>

<p><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/hhpccweb/project/mental-health-clinic/">Hall health</a> is a full service health clinic. Mental Health services at Hall Health are free for students on the GAIP plan. <a href="http://www.washington.edu/counseling/">The Counseling Center</a> is funded by student fees, and is therefore free for all students (even without insurance).</p>

<p>Both services offer:</p>

<ul>

<li>Same and next day support

<ul>

<li>if you are in need of immediate care, you can be seen the same day</li>

<li>for less urgent needs, you can be seen the next day to talk about options for further care</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Individual Therapy

<ul>

<li>there is usually a large waiting period to be seen</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Group Therapy

<ul>

<li>available groups change each quarter but generally there are groups for perfectionism, survivors of sexual violence,</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, Hall health offers:</p>

<ul>

<h2 id="resources-off-campus">Resources off Campus</h2>

<p>Off campus care allows for long term treatment. Hall Health is able to recommend in network providers at a same/next day appointment. You can also use your insurance’s website to search for in network providers.</p>

<p>For GAIP members, off campus mental healthcare has a waived deductible, and is covered at 90% for in network providers and 60% for out of network providers.</p>
