The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recently (2018) released a [report](https://doi.org/10.17226/24994) on sexual harassment in academia. This report discusses the effects of sexual harassment and the institutional conditions under which sexual harassment is more likely to occur. It also provides recommendations about what the academic community can do to address these concerns.
        
A 2003 [study](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-6570.2003.tb00752.x) comparing incidence rates of sexual harassment across academic, private-sector, government, and military respondents and found that academic workplaces have the second highest rate of sexual harassment at 58 percent (only lower than military).
