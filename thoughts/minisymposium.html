<h1>Organizing an equitable minisymposium</h1>
<p class="author"><a href="https://chen.pw">Tyler Chen</a></p>
<p>Conferences are an important means by which information about new research is shared. … networking …</p>
<p>In applied math, the many conferences consist primarily of “minisymposia”, or similar collections of related talks which are organized by various community members.
These minisymposia are often more specialized in scope than conference as a whole, and speakers are typically invited by the minisymposium organizer based on personal connections and relevance to the chosen topic.</p>
<p>While it’s common that “organizers are especially encouraged to include speakers from more than one country and from underrepresented groups, including women and minorities, whenever appropriate”, what this means in practice, and how to achieve an equitable speaker lineup is more or less “left as an exercise to the organizer”.
For instance, while SIAM provides an overview for <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/about-siam-conferences/conference-guidelines/detail/guidelines-for-preparing-a-minisymposium-proposal">organizing a minisymposium</a>, the preceding quote is a somewhat nebulous suggestion, and it is entirely unclear what this means in practice.</p>
<p>This post aims to providing concrete suggestions for how to organize a minisymposium with speakers from a diverse set of backgrounds. (reword)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>select a broad enough topic
<ul>
<li>consider potential speakers prior to selecting a topic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>invite early career researchers, PhD students, researchers from industry, etc.</li>
<li>deliberately build a diverse network of researchers acquaintances</li>
<li>be patient when waiting for responses from potential speakers</li>
</ol>
<h2>Picking the right topic</h2>
<p>For instance, shifting the topic from conjugate gradient to one on Krylov subspace methods significantly widens the pool of potential speakers, while still allowing ..</p>
<p>Of course, there is a fine balance in topic speificity</p>
<p>too broad a topic defeats point of minisymposium.</p>
<h2>Younger speakers / speakers from outside academia</h2>
<p>While the research mathematics community is becoming increasingly diverse, much of this increased diversity is due to the increased diversity seen in STEM education, and has yet to reach the upper levels of academia.</p>
<p>For example, in the mathematical science, while new male PhDs in outnumber new female PhDs by a ratio of about 2:1, male doctoral faculty outnumber female doctoral faculty by a ratio of 5:1.
While this isn’t a particularly surprising observation (after all, it takes time to change the demographics of an entire industry), it does provide a very simple approach to finding a more diverse set of speakers: consider younger speakers.</p>
<p>something about position - good to have more established people too
- especially if you have younger ppl then it is a change for the younger ppl to get on the radar of big name ppl</p>
<p>something about enabling and lifting up ppl..</p>

<h2>Building connections</h2>
<p>think about who you network with at conferences, how that impacts your circle of research acquaintances etc.</p>
<h2>…</h2>
<p>Recently, I organized a minisymposium on <a href="https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=67748">Krylov subspace methods</a> as part of <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/pp20">Parallel Processing 2020</a>.
This was the first minisymposium I have organized, and while I certainly feel that there are many things which I can improve on in the future, there are some useful lessons which I have learned in the process which I would like to share.</p>
<p>Originally I had intended for the minisymposium to focus on high performance variants of the conjugate gradient (CG) and Lanczos algorithms.
While this would certainly have been an appropriate topic for a minisymposium in the conference, the number of people working on this problem is fairly small.
As a natural result, this means that there are not that many women and other underrepresented minorities who could be potential speakers.</p>
<p>Instead I chose to broaden the scope of the minisymposium to Krylov subspace methods in general, which encompasses CG and Lanczos, but also includes many other methods.
This meant the set of potential speakers was broadened significantly.</p>
