<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<p>This is a collection of some thoughts from my experience in academia.
A lot of what’s written here has probably already been said before in one way or another.

<h2><a href="./mental_health.html">Department culture and mental health</a></h2>
<p>I discuss imposter syndrome and the overuse of imposter syndrome as a catch-all for any negative feelings encountered in grad school before transitioning into some ideas on how to creating supportive department cultures.</p>
<h2><a href="./reproducibility.html">Reproducibility, Inclusivity, and Open Science</a></h2>
<p>I argue that open source software is important for reproducibility, both in the sense that the setup of an experiment must be well described, and in the sense that it is important to include as many groups and people in the reproduction process as possible.</p>
